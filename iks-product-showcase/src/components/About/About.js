        The IKS Interns Team was born with the introduction of a new initiative
        by IEEE Kerala Section to select a group of resourceful interns to its
        Electronic Communications Coordination team. As a result, a team of
        sixteen interns was formed, headed by Ms. Sarada Jayakrishnan, Chair,
        IEEE Kerala Section, and handled by Mr. Alan Mathew, ECC, IEEE Kerala
        Section. Divided into three groups - Web Team, Design Team, and Content
        Team - the Interns Team consists of students from the different Student
        Branches of the Section. Conceived from an idea aimed at training and
        mentoring a selected number of students and transforming them into
        valuable volunteers determined to work for the betterment of the
        Section, the Interns Team has considerably grown to handle tasks within
        a professional network. In a span of seven months, the team has been
        successful in completing various projects and Section related
        activities, showcasing enhanced skillset, attained as a result of
        brilliant mentorship and rigorous team management.
